## List, create, delete, and modify physical storage partitions

* `lsblk` -> lists all available disk devices plus available partitions.
  * Use `-f` to show filesystem type.

* `parted` -> is another tool doing the same. Used for scripting.

* `fdisk` -> it is used to manage disk partition in MBR modality.

  * E.g. `fdisk /dev/sda`

    This will open an interactive menu that will permit to show current status of partitions or create a delete new partitions.

* `gdisk` -> it is used to manage disk partition in GPT modality.

  - E.g. `gdisk /dev/sda`

* Destroy all MBR partition on a disk.

  * `gdisk /dev/sda` -> `x` (expert) -> `z` (zap)

* Convert MBR to GPT.

  * `gdisk /dev/sda` -> `W` -> `Y`

  * GPT held a copy of the partition table at the end of the disk.


## Manage and configure LVM storage

* Before creating a Logical Volume you first need to created a physical volume and after that a volume group.

* A physical volume is a partition that can be part of volume group. Inside a volume group can be created logical volume.

* The advantage of logical volume is that their size can be managed easly.

* If more space is needed a volume group can be extended as well.

* `lvmdiskscan` - can be used to view on which partitions are LVM enabled.

Physical Volume

* `pvcreate /dev/sdb1` -> To create a physical volume with partition sbd1.

* `pvs` -> Lists available physical volumes.

* `pvdisplay /dev/sdb1` -> Shows info of a physical volume.

* `pvmove /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc10` -> Move the Volume to new disk.

Volume Group

* `vgcreate vgname /dev/sdb1` -> To create a volume group called *vgname* and add the sdb1 physical volume to it.

* `vgs` -> Lists available volume groups.

* `vgdisplay vgname` -> Shows info of a volume group.

* `vgextend vgname /dev/sdc3` -> Extends a volume group adding a new physical volume `/dev/sdc3`

* `vgreduce vgname /dev/sdc3` -> Remove physical volume from a volume group.

Logical volume

* `lvcreate -n volumename -L 10G vgname`

  To create a logical volume called *volumename*  of size 10GB on volume group *vgname*.

* `lvcreate -n volumename -l 100%FREE vgname`

  To create a logical volume called *volumename*  with all available space on volume group *vgname*.

* `lvs` -> List available logical volumes.

* `lvdisplay` -> Shows info of all logical volumes.

* `lvdisplay vgname/volumename` -> Shows info of a logical volume *volumename* contained in *vgname* volume group.

* Before using a logical volume, file system must be created on it with: `mkfs -t ext4 /dev/vgname/volumename`

* Add entry to `/etc/fstab`
  * `blkid /dev/vgname/volumename` -> shows the UUID of a formatted volume group.
  * You can use: `/dev/mapper/vgname-volumename` or `/dev/vgname/volumename` it's the same.

* `lvextend -L +1G -r vgname/volumename ` -> Extends the logical volume *volumename* of one giga and resize.

  * `-r`  is used to resize file system.
  * For xfs use `xfs_growfs /lvm` to resize the filesystem. 
  * To resize ExtN use -r or `resize2fs /dev/vgname/volumename`.
  * The size of xfs filesystem cannot be reduced!

* `lvextend -l +100%FREE -r /dev/mapper/vgname-volumename` - It is important to include the minus (-) or plus (+) signs while resizing a logical volume. Otherwise, youâ€™re setting a fixed size for the LV instead of resizing it.

* `lvreduce -L -1G -r vgname/volumename ` -> Reduce the logical volume *volumename* of one giga and resize.

* `sudo lvresize -L +5G --resizefs vgname/volumename` -> You can use resize command also. -r == --resizefs

* `lvcreate -L 30M -s -n backup /dev/vgname/volumename` -> Create LVM Snapshot.
  * `mount /dev/vgname/volumename/backup /mnt -o nouuid,ro` -> Mount the backup somewhere.

* Migrate PVs:

## Create and configure encrypted storage

* To use encrypted storage a kernel module must be loaded
  * `sudo modprobe dm_crypt` -> Loads kernel module dm_crypt.
  * `echo dm_crypt >> /etc/modules-load.d/dm_crypt.conf` -> Load dm_crypt module automatically when system will be restarted.
  * `lsmod` -> Lists all loaded kernel modules.
* `yum -y install cryptsetup` -> Install software used to manage encrypted storage.

* `shred -v /dev/vg1/lv1` -> Overwrite a file to hide its contents.

Encrypt

* `cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/vgname/volumename` -> Encrypts a logical volume *volumename* contained in *vgname* volume group.

  * A password must be provided.
  * When confirmation will be required insert a capital <u>YES</u>.

  * **NOTE**: this command can be used with physical volume as well.

* `cryptsetup luksDump /dev/vgname/volumename` -> Show header information of a LUKS device.

* `cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/vgname/volumename namenewdevice`

  It open encrypted volume and associate it to a new device called *namenewdevice*

  * Password must be provided

* `mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/namenewdevice` -> It creates a file system in *namenewdevice*.

  - Now the new device can be mounted.

Close device

* Unmount device
* `cryptsetup close namenewdevice` -> close *namenewdevice*

Automount

* `echo "passwd" >> /root/key` -> Insert a string that will be used as authentication key to open device.

* `chmod 400 /root/key` -> Reduces permission on key file.
* `cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/mapper/namenewdevice /root/key` -> Add key to encrypted device called *namenewdevice*
* Edit `/etc/crypttab` and add below row:
  * `namenewdevice /dev/vgname/volumename /root/key`

* Add below row to `/etc/fstab`
  * `/dev/mapper/namenewdevice /mnt/mountpoint ext4 defaults 0 0`

* Reboot system or reload system manager
  * `systemctl daemon-reload`
* The new encrypted volume will be mounted on `/mnt/mountpoint`

## Configure systems to mount file systems at or during boot

* Edit `/etc/fstab` adding a row similar to:

  * /dev/sdb1 /mnt/mountpoint ext4 defaults 0 0

    * Mount device sdb1 to mountpoint. 

    * Device is formatted using ext4 filesystem.

    * Default mount options are used
    * 0 0 -> Dump (bkp) and fsck. 
      * First 0 means no backup required
      * Second 0 means no fsck required in case of not correct umount. To enable fsck insert 2 because number indicate the check order, and 1 is given to operating system disk and two do data disks.

* `mount` -> Shows mounted volumes.

* `mount -a` -> Reloads /etc/fstab.

* `mount -t type  -o options device dir`

  * It mounts a *device* formatted with file system *type* on directory *dir* using a list of options.

  * Mount options can be found in `man mount`. There are general options for all FS and specific to FS. List of general mount options:
    * async -> I/O asincrono
    * auto -> Can be mounted using mount -a
    * default -> Equal to this list of options: async,auto,dev,exec,nouser,rw,suid
    * loop -> To mount an ISO image
    * noexec -> no exec
    * nouser -> A user cannot mount this volume
    * remount -> Mount volume also if it is already mounted
    * ro -> Read only
    * rw -> Read an write
    * relatime -> Modify file access time (atime) if file is changed or one time a day. Alternative, to reduce disk traffic, noatime can be used. This is useful with SSD to avoid not useful write.

***SMB protocol***

* `yum -y install samba samba-client cifs-utils` -> it installs software need to manage CIFS/SMB protocol

* Samba configuration file: ` /etc/samba/smb.conf`

* `smbclient -L targetIP`

  It lists all SMB shared directory available on a target IP

  * root password must be provided

* `mount -t cifs -o username=smbuser,password=1234pwd //192.168.0.10/share /media/samba`

  It mounts a directory *share*, shared by server 192.168.0.10 on samba directory. User and password to authentication are provided

* Permanent configuration
  * `echo "username=smbuser" >> /media/smb/.smbconf` # can be any file name, just change the perm.
  * `echo "password=1234pwd" >> /media/smb/.smbconf`
  * `chmod 600 /media/smb/.smbconf`
  * In `/etc/fstab` insert:
    * `//192.168.0.10/share /media/samba cifs credentials=/media/samba/.smbcredentials,defaults 0 0`

***NFS protocol***

* `yum -y install nfs-utils` -> it install software to manage NFS protocol.
  1. `systemctl enable nfs-server --now`
  2. Shared files are configure in `/etc/exports` like this:
      ```bash
      /exports_nfs/docs 192.168.233.0/24(ro,no_subtree_check)
      # If no_root_squash option is used, remote root users are able to change any file on the shared file system
      ```
  3. Run the following: `exportfs -rv`

* `showmount -e targetIP`

  It lists all NFS shared directory available on a target IP

* `mount -t nfs -o defaults 192.168.0.10:/srv/nfs /media/nfs`

  It mounts a directory *nfs*, shared by server 192.168.0.10 on nfs directory

* Permanent configuration

  * In `/etc/fstab` insert:
    * `192.168.0.10:/srv/nfs /media/nfs nfs defaults 0 0`
  * To user NFSv3 insert:
    * `192.168.0.10:/srv/nfs /media/nfs nfs defaults,vers=3 0 0`

  Example: NFS create nfs share and give it ro insecure access to network xx.xx.xx.xx & give rw secure access to example.com
    - `/nfs/share xx.xx.xx.xx(ro,insecure) example.com(rw,secure)`

  For more info: `man exports`

* **Note** Use Samba in a mixed environment and NFS whenever cross-platform compatibility is not necessary.


## Configure and manage swap space

* To use a device as swap space:
  * `mkswap /dev/sdb3`
  * `swapon -v /deb/sdb3`
  * In `/etc/fstab` insert:
    *  `/dev/sdb3 swap swap defaults 0 0`

  * `swapon --show` -> Display swap usage summary or: `cat /proc/swaps`
  * `swapoff /dev/sdb3` -> Disable the swap.
  * `swapon -p 10 /dev/sd3` -> Starts the swap and give it priority of 10. The higher priority is used first. Can be configured directly in */etc/fstab* replacing *defaults* with *sw,pri=10*

- You can also use file as swap space. The commands are the same.

## Create and manage RAID devices

Concepts:

* Parity disk. It is used to provide fault tolerance. 
* The spare device. It doesn't take part of the RAID(Redundant Array of Independent Disks) and it is used only in case of a disk fault. In this case spare enter in the RAID and the content of lost disk is reconstructed and saved on it.


* `yum -y install mdadm` -> Installs software to manage RAID devices.
* RAID 0 - Striped - No spare

  * `mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=stripe --raid-devices=2 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1`
* RAID 1 - Mirror

  * `mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1`

* RAID 5 - (1 parity + 1 spare)
  * `mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=5 --raid-devices=3 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1`
    `/dev/sdd1 --spare-devices=1 /dev/sde1`
* RAID 6 - (2 parity + 1 spare)
  * `mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=6 --raid-devices=4 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1`
    `/dev/sdd1 /dev/sde --spare-devices=1 /dev/sdf1`

* RAID 10 - (Stripe + Mirror + 1 spare)

  * `mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md0 --level=10 --raid-devices=4 /dev/sd[b-e]1 --spare-devices=1 /dev/sdf1`  

* `mdadm --detail /dev/md0` -> Shows status of RAID device.

* To use device md0, format it and use as a classical device.

* `cat /proc/mdstat` -> Give general info.

Monitoring RAID devices:

* `mdadm --assemble --scan`
* `mdadm --detail --scan >> /etc/mdadm.conf` -> Write configuration to the configuration file. This file helps to reinitialize RAID device after reboot.

* `echo "MAILADDR root" >> /etc/mdadm.conf`
* `systemctl start mdmonitor`
* `systemctl enable mdmonitor`

***Add disk:***

* `mdadm /dev/md0 --add /dev/sbc2`

* `mdadm --grow --raid-devices=4 /dev/md0` - It adds a spare disk and after it grows array.

***Remove disk:***

* `mdadm /dev/md0 --fail /dev/sdc1 --remove /dev/sdc1`
  
  `mdadm --grow /dev/md0 --raid-devices=2`

  It mark disk as failed and remove it. After that the size of array must be adjusted.

***Delete RAID:***

* Unmount device
* `mdadm --stop /dev/md0`
* `mdadm --zero-superblock /dev/sbc2` -> It cleans the partition that can be resused later.


## Configure systems to mount file systems on demand

* `yum -y install autofs` installs software need to manage automount.

Automount NFS directory

* Edit `/etc/auto.master` and insert:
  * `/misc /etc/auto.misc`

* Edit `/etc/auto.misc` and insert:
  * `nfs -fstype=nfs 192.168.0.10:/srv/nfs`
  * `sten-automount -fstype=ext4 :/dev/sdb1`

* `systemctl start autofs`


## Create, manage and diagnose advanced file system permissions

**ACL - Access control list** 

* They must be supported by the filesystem or build-in into the kernel. Check the kernel with the follwoing: `grep ACL /boot/config-$(uname -r)`

* With some old filesystem a mount option (e.g. *acl*) must be provided to enable ACL.

* Check the *default* mount option for ext4(/dev/sdb1) -> `tune2fs -l /dev/sdb1 | grep -i default`

* `getfacl file` -> shows ACL applied to a file.

* `setfacl -R -m g:sales:rx file` -> set ACL on file.

  * `-R` -> recursive, if file is a directory, ACL will be applied to all file inside it.
  * `-m` -> modify
  * `g:sales:rx` -> group sales can read and execute
    * `g` group
    * `u` user
    * `o` other

* `setfacl -m u:dummy:- file` -> remove all permissions of user dummy. 

* `setfacl -m d:g:sales:rx directory` -> Set a default ACL to a directory. In this way all files created inside it will have same ACL as default.

  The default ACL is a specific type of permission assigned to a directory, that doesnâ€™t change the permissions of the directory itself, but makes so that specified ACLs are set by default on all the files created inside of it.

* If an ACL is applied, when `ls -la` is executed an + is inserted after other permissions. The "." in the end shows that ACL is supported.

* `setfacl -x u:test:w test` -> remove ACL.
* `setfacl -x u:test: test` -> Or try this way.

* `setfacl -b file` -> removes all ACL.

**Extended attributes**

* Extended attributes are file properties.
* With some old filesystem a mount option (e.g. *user_xattr*) must be provided to enable extended attributes.

* Only root user can remove an attribute!
* `chattr +i file` -> Add *immutable* attribute to a file. It cannot be deleted or removed.
* `chattr -i file` -> Remove *immutable* attribute from a file.
* `chattr +a file` -> The file can only be opened in append mode for writing.
* `chattr +A file` -> When a file with this attribute set is open, its atime(last time the file was accessed/opened) record is not changed.
* `lsattr file` -> shows file's extended attributes.
* To find more attribute have a look here: `man chattr`


## Setup user and group disk quotas for filesystems

***ext quota:***
* **Quota**: space that can be used by an user on one specific filesystem.
  * NOTE: To limit space in a directory it is better create a specific mount point with a specific partition.
* `yum -y install quota` -> installs software need to manage quota.
* ***usrquota,grpquota*** mount options must be inserted for filesystem to which enable quota (e.g. editing `/etc/fstab`)
* After that options are inserted, remount partition to enable them.
* After remount execute `quotacheck -mavug` that check used blocks and inserted them in a tracking file.
  * Two files will be created:
    * aquota.group
    * aquota.user
* `quotaon -a` -> Start quota system.
  * Alternative:
  * `quotaon -vu /mnt/mountpoint` -> It starts only quota user for specific mountpoint.
  * `quotaon -vg /mnt/mountpoint` -> It starts only quota group for specific mountpoint.
* `quota -vu user` -> shows user's quota.
* The quota is specified in blocks of 1K size and in number of inode that is the number of files that can be created.
* Hard limit: maxim value allowed.
* Soft limit: a limit that can be exceeded for a *grace period*. Default *grace period* is one week.
* When grace period is reached, soft limit become and hard limit.
* `setquota -u hriska 20000 25000 0 0 /dev/sdd2` - Set block limit quota for user hriska.
* `edquota -t` -> Edit the grace period. Is an unique value for the whole system.
* `edquota -u user` -> Edit user's quota.
  * In each column can be insert a value for soft and hard limit for blocks and inode.
  * **NOTE**: Normally soft and hard limits are configured equal to avoid confusion. 
* `repquota -aug` -> It shows an overview of current quota for each users.

* Soft limit=900 and the hard limit=1000 blocks (**1024 bytes/block * 1000 blocks = 1024000 bytes = 1 MB**) of disk space usage.

***xfs quotas:***

* Valid quota mount options are:
  * uquota/uqnoenforce: User quotas
  * gquota/gqnoenforce: Group quotas
  * pquota/pqnoenforce: Project quota

* `xfs_quota`
  * -c is command -x is expert mode.
  * `xfs_quota -c "quota delme1"` -> Show quota for user delme1.
  * `xfs_quota -xc "report -h" /mnt/quota` -> Enter expert mode and show quota for `/mnt/quota`.
  * `xfs_quota -xc "limit -u bsoft=30m bhard=40m delme1" /mnt/quota` -> Set block quota  for user delme1.

## Create and configure file systems

* `mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1` -> Creates an filesystem ext4 on sdb1 partition.

* `mkfs -t ext4 -L DATA /dev/sdb5` -> Creates the filesystem and label it.

* `tune2fs -L MY_DATA /dev/sdb5` -> Change the label of the *ext* filesystem. Can also be used to change other params like: filesystem_check count and count, etc.

* `dumpe2fs /dev/sdb5` -> Give information for *ext* filesystem.

* `fsck.ext4 /dev/sdb1` -> Checks the integrity of sdb1 filesystem.

* `mount -o remount,noexec /dev/sdb1 /data/ext4` -> Add new mount option - *noexec*.

* `umount /data/ext4` -> Unmount the partition.

* For ***xfs*** use the following command. A lot of more options. Used in Enterprises:
  - `mkfs.xfs -b size=1k -l size=10m /dev/sdb3`
  - `xfs_db -x /dev/sdb3` -> Open interactive menu.
  - `xfs_admin -L STEN_XFS_ww /dev/sten/mirrored` -> Change label. xfs_admin uses the xfs_db(8) command to modify various parameters of a filesystem. Nice tool!
